        <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
        <p> &#189; cup unsweetened plain almond milk <br>
            &#190; Tbsp chia seeds <br>
            2 Tbsp natural salted peanut butter or almond butter <br>
            1 Tbsp maple syrup <br>
            &#189; cup gluten-free rolled oats <br>
            Sliced banana, strawberries, or raspberries <br>
            Flaxseed meal or additional chia seed <br>
            Granola </p>
            <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
            <p> 1. To a mason jar or small bowl with a lid, add almond milk, chia seeds, peanut butter, and maple syrup (or other sweetener) 
                and stir with a spoon to combine. The peanut butter doesn't need to be completely mixed with the almond milk (doing so leaves 
                swirls of peanut butter to enjoy the next day).<br>
                2. Add oats and stir a few more times. Then press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in almond milk. <br>
                3. Cover securely with a lid or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak. <br>
                4. The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings. <br>
            </p>
            <p><b>OPTIONAL &#58; </b> You can also heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there's enough room at the top of your jar to 
                allow for expansion and prevent overflow), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through. Add more liquid 
                as needed if oats get too thick/dry. <br>
                <i>Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours 
                in our experience. Not freezer friendly.</i>
