        <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
        <p> 100g pancetta <br>
            50g pecorino cheese <br>
            50g parmesan <br>
            3 large eggs <br>
            350g spaghetti <br>
            2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole <br>
            50g unsalted butter <br>
            sea salt and freshly grated black pepper <br></p>
        <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
        <p> 1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. <br>
            2. Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together. <br>
            3. Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside. <br>
            4. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, 
            covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked). <br>
            5. Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. <br>
            6. While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, 
            as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic. <br>
            7. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted 
            its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard. <br>
            8. Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in 
            the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw 
            the pasta water away yet.<br>
            9. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. <br>
            10. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, 
            lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated. <br>
            11. Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a 
            little salt, if needed. <br>
            12. Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining 
            cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and 
            the glossy sauciness will be revived. <br></p>
